# Quadratic Funding

This is an experimental repo that serves 2 missions:
1. Experiment quadratic funding
2. Use this opportunity to learn Rust coding

## Experiment Quadratic Funding
Quadratic Funding is a more democratic and scalable form of matching funding for public goods, i.e. any projects valuable to large groups of people and accessible to the general public.
“Matching funding” is a model of funding public goods where a fund from governments or philanthropic institutions matches individual contributions to a project. Plural Funding optimizes matching funds by prioritizing projects based on the number of people who contributed. This way, funds meant to benefit the public go towards projects that really benefit a broad public, instead of things that only have a few wealthy backers. [1]

The interested reader can dig deeper the subject with the following readings:
- A flexible design for funding public goods - Vitalik Buterin, Zoë Hitzig, E. Glen Weyl
- The Handbook for Radical Local Democracy - Matt Prewitt, Paul Healy

This repo aims to design a naive simulation of using quadratic funding in a democracy.

## Opportunistic learning of Rust
I've been looking for an opportunity to learn rust for a long time now.
It may have been better to use Python for this specific project as it could have opened the door for possible reinforcement learning based simulation (determining the strategies adopted by agents to maximize their interest).
But for now, I'd rather constrain the study and learn Rust.
